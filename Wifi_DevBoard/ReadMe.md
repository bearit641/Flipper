# Some quick steps to get [Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder) installed<br>
(Direct from the dev WillStunForFood on Discord - check out [his video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YLTpNo5xa0) too!):

- Plug the WiFi dev board directly into your PC
- Upload the MarauderOTA firmware from source via Arduino IDE
- Use the MarauderOTA firmware to flash the Marauder Flipper bin over WiFi

The first step in the wiki documentation [starts here](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/flipper-zerowhile).<br>
(Then you should have the necessary links to the follow on documentation to get the firmware installed.)

ESP32-S2 is the correct board if you are installing on the Flipper WiFi Dev Board. <br>
If you are using the Marauder OTA method, you shouldn't have to install any libraries. <br>
The only other thing you should have to install is the boards for the ESP32 in the Arduino IDE and the drivers for the ESP32-S2.
