Various SUB files I've found or created. Some tested, some not. Special thanks to [FalsePhilosopher](https://github.com/FalsePhilosopher) for organization help!

*** NOTE: The deBruijn and OpenSesame files have moved to the [Gates subfolder](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Sub-GHz/Gates/deBruijn). ***

You can generate MANY of your own SUBs, such as MegaCode and Firefly, over at [Flipper Maker](https://flippermaker.github.io/).

Looking to mess with garage doors? You can try the OpenSesame/deBruijn files above. (Also check out more info at [RemoteDup](https://www.ifoedit.com/RemoteDup.html), [GarageHack](https://www.ifoedit.com/garagehack.html), and [Learn Button coding](https://support.dealer.liftmaster.com/articles/Knowledge/Determine-the-Color-of-the-Learn-Button-on-Your-Garage-Door-Opener).

Officially supported frequencies are 300-348 MHz, 387-464 MHz, and 779-928 MHz (from [CC1101 chip docs](https://www.ti.com/product/CC1101))<br>
Unofficially supported frequencies are 281-361 MHz, 378-481 MHz, and 749-962 MHz (from [YARD Stick One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/yardstickone/) docs)

**NOTE: Going outside the supported frequencies may DAMAGE YOUR FLIPPER.<br>
Please understand what you're doing if trying to break out of official frequencies.**

You'll need to edit some code and recompile if you want to break outside the officially supported frequencies. ([Hint here...](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/pull/1287/files))
